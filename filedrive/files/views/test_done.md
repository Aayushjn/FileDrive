Here’s a breakdown of what has been tested in each of the specified test files:

---

### **1. `test_models.py`**

#### **Tests Performed:**
- **Model Functionality**:
  - Validates custom methods or properties of the models (`UploadedItem`, `SharedItem`, etc.).
  - Tests file metadata, such as:
    - File name (`name` property).
    - File size (`size` property).

- **File Hash Generation**:
  - Ensures the `file_hash` is correctly generated when a file is uploaded.

- **Object Relationships**:
  - Tests relationships between models (e.g., `owner` and `shared_with` in `SharedItem`).

---

### **2. `test_views.py`**

#### **Tests Performed:**
- **File Upload (`/upload`)**:
  - Tests successful uploads for authenticated users.
  - Validates file replacement behavior when a file with the same name is uploaded (file name collisions).

- **File Retrieval (`file` endpoint)**:
  - **GET Request**:
    - Ensures the correct file content and headers are returned when a file is downloaded using its `file_hash`.
  - **DELETE Request**:
    - Verifies that the file is deleted by its owner.
    - Ensures unauthorized deletion attempts return `403 Forbidden`.

- **Home Page (`/home`)**:
  - Validates the rendering of the home page.
  - Tests if the correct context (e.g., `crumb_title`, uploaded files) is passed to the template.

---

### **3. `test_forms.py`**

#### **Tests Performed:**
- **Signup Form (`SignupForm`)**:
  - Verifies form validation for:
    - Required fields (`email`, `password1`, `password2`, `first_name`, `last_name`).
    - Password matching and complexity rules.
  - Ensures valid form data results in successful user creation.

- **Login Form (`AuthForm`)**:
  - Tests form validation for:
    - Valid credentials.
    - Invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect password or email).
  - Ensures form errors are displayed for invalid submissions.

---

### **4. `test_urls.py`**

#### **Tests Performed:**
- **URL Configuration**:
  - Tests whether all the key URLs in `files/urls.py` are correctly mapped to their corresponding views.
  - Example:
    - `/upload` → `upload` view.
    - `/file/<file_hash>` → `file` view.
    - `/trash` → `trash` view.
  
- **HTTP Response**:
  - Ensures each URL returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., `200 OK` for valid endpoints and `404 Not Found` for invalid ones).

### **Summary of Test Coverage**

| **Test File**  | **Scope of Testing**                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `test_models.py` | Tests model methods, properties, and relationships.  |
| `test_views.py`  | Validates views like `/upload`, `/file`, and `/home`. |
| `test_forms.py`  | Tests form validation for `SignupForm` and `AuthForm`.|
| `test_urls.py`   | Verifies URL-to-view mappings and response statuses. |
